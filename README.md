# XQuery-XML
I am using XQuery to query XML Data.
XQuery is a language for finding and extracting elements and attributes from XML documents.
In my repositoriy, I have book.xml data. I created index.xqy where the xqy access books.xml and using for loop it prints our the elements of xml to html. 
It is important to have XQuery.jar that allows you to use their functions and operators.
In visual studio, "java -jar XQuery.jar index.xqy > index.html" should be used to pass those xml data to html and create webpage
